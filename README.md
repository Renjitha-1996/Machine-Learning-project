# Machine-Learning-project

# Overview
This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning regression algorithms. The dataset contains various features of cars such as brand, model, fuel type, horsepower, and more. The project covers the entire pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.

# Steps Involved:

# 1. Loading and Preprocessing:
     *. Load the dataset.
     *. Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical data as required.

# 2. Model Implementation:
     *. Implement five regression models:
     *. Linear Regression
     *. Decision Tree Regressor
     *. Random Forest Regressor
     *. Gradient Boosting Regressor
     *. Support Vector Regressor

# 3. Model Evaluation:
     *. Compare the performance of all the models based on:
        1. R-squared
        2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
        3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
     *. Identify the best performing model and justify why it is the best.

# 4. Feature Importance Analysis:
     *. Perform feature selection to identify the most significant variables affecting car prices.

# 5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
     *. Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for the best-performing models (e.g., Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) to improve performance.
